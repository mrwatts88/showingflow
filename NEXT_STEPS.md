# Next Steps

This file is the live handoff for the next session. It should be updated whenever a meaningful chunk of work is completed.

## Last Completed

- Added a multi-stage Dockerfile for `services/showingflow-api`.
- Switched Spring datasource config to support `SPRING_DATASOURCE_*` environment variable overrides with local defaults.
- Expanded Docker Compose so the API and PostgreSQL can run together as a local stack.
- Added `COMMANDS.md` and `DETAILS.md` to document runtime flows and system behavior.

## Current Verified State

- The Spring API service exists in `services/showingflow-api`.
- The `brokerages` slice is implemented end to end.
- PostgreSQL can run by itself in Docker Compose.
- The full local stack can run in Docker Compose with:
  - `postgres` as the database service
  - `api` as the Spring container
- The containerized API connects to PostgreSQL by service name using:
  - `jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/showingflow`
- The API also supports host-run mode with local defaults using:
  - `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/showingflow`
- Host ports in Compose are configurable with:
  - `SHOWINGFLOW_POSTGRES_PORT`
  - `SHOWINGFLOW_API_PORT`

## Recommended Next Tasks

1. Update `README.md` so it reflects the current real runtime modes instead of only the longer-term target architecture.
2. Add `.dockerignore` under `services/showingflow-api` to keep the image build context cleaner and more stable.
3. Decide whether the next major effort is:
   - another backend slice such as `listings`, or
   - delivery work such as CI for tests and Docker image builds

## Risks And Gaps

- `README.md` likely lags behind the current containerized runtime setup.
- There is still only one implemented domain slice.
- CI/CD does not exist yet.
- The worker service, frontend, infrastructure, and observability remain mostly planned rather than implemented.

## Resume Commands

Start the full stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

Start the full stack on alternate host ports:

```bash
SHOWINGFLOW_POSTGRES_PORT=5433 SHOWINGFLOW_API_PORT=8081 \
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

Run PostgreSQL only, then run the API on the host:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres
cd services/showingflow-api
./gradlew bootRun
```

Check health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

Stop the stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down
```

## Verification Notes

- The Compose file was validated with `docker compose config`.
- The full stack was brought up successfully in Compose.
- Compose verification required using an alternate PostgreSQL host port on this machine because port `5432` was already in use locally.
- API container logs showed successful Spring startup, Flyway migration execution, and a live database connection to `postgres:5432`.
